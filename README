In order to run the bot, you need a file called BotConfig.py which looks like the following:

cat > BotConfig.py
UID=[reddit account login id]
PASSWD=[password if UID's account]
subreddits=['list', 'of' 'subreddits', 'to', 'listen', 'to']
^D

When run the bot creates two sqlite databases, one for BGG URL queries and one for keeping track of comments and responses. The default names are:

    UID-bot.db - the comment database
    UID-bgg.db - the BGG access cache database

where UID is the UID of the bot, usually "r2d8".
