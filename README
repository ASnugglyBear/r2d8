When run the bot creates two sqlite databases, one for BGG URL queries and one for keeping track of comments and responses. The default names are:

    UID-bot.db - the comment database
    UID-bgg.db - the BGG access cache database

where UID is the UID of the bot, usually "r2d8". 

Currently the bot acknowledges ^C, but does not exit. One consume thread is not dying for some reason.

Requirements:
 - PRAW
 - boardgamegeek
 - sqlite3 (included in most distributions, I think.)

For authorization an file in the current directory must exist, must be named "r2d8_auth.py" and must export a method named login() that logs into Reddit and returns a PRAW Reddit instance. See https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/3cm1p8/how_to_make_your_bot_use_oauth2/ for details.
